# Code-Jam-Web-Wrapper

## THIS APP IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

During a five day code jam me and my team were tasked with building a mobile app. Being the only person with mobile 
app experience we abandoned that idea to instead develop a node.js web app. This way everyone could contribute.
I developed this Android app at home to serve as a web wrapper around that web app. Thus, we could continue development on 
our web app while having a fully funtioning prototype that operates on the Andriod SDK.

Note: This app is very, very simple. With over 3 years of Android experience, I was able to write it in a day. I'm keeping it here for anyone
who just wants an android app to wrap their deployed web interface. Just change the [HOMEPAGE_URL](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Code-Jam-Web-Wrapper/blob/6db5c8c2736d72a00e1b8b29014efa49ed473994/app/src/main/java/adams/justice/myapplication/WebWrapperActivity.java#L21), [APP_ROOT_STRING](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Code-Jam-Web-Wrapper/blob/6db5c8c2736d72a00e1b8b29014efa49ed473994/app/src/main/java/adams/justice/myapplication/WebWrapperActivity.java#L20), and the icons housed
in the [resources folder](https://github.com/justiceadamsUNI/Code-Jam-Web-Wrapper/tree/master/app/src/main/res) and you should be on your way.

Second Note: Because our code jam project was internally developed, it was internally hosted so I changed the URL to just point at 
principal.com for the purpose of this repo. I wish I could show you the teams real work! Anyway here's a screenshot of the app
loading a bootstrap website. ([Principals website](https://www.principal.com/)).
